Something is happening out there, some anomaly. It is creating leaks in the void. 

These leaks are no regular leaks, they are portals to MythOS. They are bringing pallets from the LavaGang into the Roomiverse. 
The creations are not the problem, it's the unstable connection between worlds that could cause corruption, 
and it could even allow void entities and cryptids into the roomiverse.

Take this as a warning, go out there, fix this mess. 
Save the Roomiverse. You can do this.
