        <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Something is happening out there, some anomaly. It is creating leaks in the void.<br>

        These leaks are no regular leaks, they are portals to MythOS. They are bringing pallets from the LavaGang into the Roomiverse.<br>
        The creations are not the problem, it's the unstable connection between worlds that could cause corruption,<br>
        and it could even allow void entities and cryptids into the roomiverse.<br>
        <br>
        Take this as a warning, go out there, fix this mess.<br> 
        Save the Roomiverse. You can do this.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Your key to the void: BONESIDE
